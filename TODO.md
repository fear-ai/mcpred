- [ ] Set up security scanning in CI pipeline

## Open Questions ‚ùì

### Technical Questions
1. **MCP SDK Integration**
   - How to properly extend the official MCP SDK without breaking compatibility?
   - What's the best way to handle SDK updates and version compatibility?

2. **Transport Implementation**
   - Should we implement custom transports or extend existing ones?
   - How to handle WebSocket transport for security testing scenarios?

3. **Configuration Management**
   - What format should `.mcpred` use (YAML, JSON, TOML)?
   - How to structure test suites and target configurations?

4. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - How to distinguish between legitimate errors and potential vulnerabilities?
   - What level of detail to include in error reporting for security analysis?

### Security Questions
1. **Testing Ethics**
   - Should we include warnings about authorized testing only?
   - How to prevent misuse while maintaining effectiveness?

2. **Vulnerability Reporting**
   - What severity classification system to use?
   - How to format security findings for different audiences?

3. **Legal Considerations**
   - What disclaimers and usage warnings are needed?
   - How to handle responsible disclosure recommendations?

## Knowledge Gaps üß†

### MCP Protocol Deep Dive
- [ ] Need deeper understanding of MCP protocol edge cases
- [ ] Unclear on all possible authentication mechanisms in MCP
- [ ] Need to research known MCP vulnerabilities and attack vectors

### Security Testing Methodologies  
- [ ] Research existing protocol fuzzing techniques for JSON-RPC
- [ ] Study OAuth 2.1 bypass techniques relevant to MCP
- [ ] Investigate DoS attack patterns for async protocols

### Python Async Patterns
- [ ] Best practices for concurrent connection testing
- [ ] Proper resource cleanup in async contexts
- [ ] Error propagation in asyncio task groups

### Competitive Analysis
- [ ] Are there similar protocol security testing tools we should study?
- [ ] What can we learn from HTTP security scanners (Burp, ZAP) for design?

## Risk Assessment ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Technical Risks
- **Medium:** MCP SDK API changes could break our extensions
- **Low:** Performance issues with concurrent testing
- **Medium:** Complex async error handling could introduce bugs

### Project Risks  
- **Low:** Scope creep adding too many features early
- **Medium:** Insufficient security testing of our own code
- **High:** Building tool that could be misused maliciously

### Mitigation Strategies
- Pin MCP SDK versions and test upgrades carefully
- Include comprehensive testing and error handling from start
- Add clear usage warnings and ethical guidelines
- Focus on defensive security use cases in documentation

## Success Metrics üìä

### Phase 1 Goals
- [ ] Successfully connect to and enumerate at least 3 different MCP servers
- [ ] CLI can discover server capabilities and output structured results
- [ ] Basic project structure supports adding new test modules
- [ ] Documentation allows new contributors to get started

### Long-term Goals
- [ ] Identify at least one real vulnerability in existing MCP implementations
- [ ] Tool adopted by security researchers and red teams
- [ ] Contribute security improvements back to MCP ecosystem
- [ ] Establish mcpred as reference security testing tool for MCP

## Notes üìù

- All local repository references are in `/Users/walter/Work/Github/`
- Focus on defensive security and authorized testing scenarios
- Maintain compatibility with official MCP specifications
- Prioritize code quality and security from the beginning
